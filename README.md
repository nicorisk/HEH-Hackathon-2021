# HEH-Hackathon-2021
School project, in which we were tasked by groups of four to design and develop an app that manages CRUD (create, read, update and delete) operations on one or multiple databases in the form of txt files.
The app is coded in C# and is using the .NET Framework
# What does the app do ?
The app's purpose is to handle player data in the context of a LAN event.

You can add players, search their nicknames in the search bar to display their profile with all their info, modify entries for a selected player, and delete a player from the list.
Every player's data is stored into a txt file and their picture/logo is stored in an img folder.
The app consists of a main window with a Data Grid that displays the current information about players stored in the database, a search bar, and buttons to either add, modify, or delete a player's profile.

Since I am attending a French speaking school, the app is in French, and so is most of the code.
This code was designed, and developped by [cocoricodai](https://github.com/cocoricodai), Sylvain Henquin (no github profile), Matteo Alcantarini (no github profile either) and myself.
